# Final Project: NFL GIS Application
**Student:** Emily Phan, phancy@uw.edu

**Quarter** Autumn 2021

In my fianl project, I decided to create a web GIS application that locates all 32 of the National Football League (NFL) team;s stadiums in the United States. Each location shows the stadium name, team name of the home team, and the capacity it holds. 

The goal of this application is for users to be able to locate all of the football stadiums used in the NFL and to check it's capacity.

The main functions of this application is that it allows users to either click on icons to see which stadium it is, or they can use the side-bar menu to click certain stadiums they want to get more information on.
